1. location accuracy: loc_accuracy - depends on how start() was setup, maybe very inaccurate due to wifi (a.k.a uses wifi carier to estimate accuracy).

Gyro
2. Quaternion attitude - orientation angles in quaternion form, no information of the order in vector components, need trasform in euler angles to use in ROS
Quaternion q = Quaternion.identity;
Vector3 v = q.ToEulerAngles();

3. Gravity - horizontal = x, vertical = y


4. rotationRate - angular rates around x, y, z a.k.a roll, pitch, yaw 

5. rotationRateUnbiase - same as rotationRate, but uncompesated raw informarmation form sensor

6. updateInterval - gyro update frequency

7. userAcceleration - (x,y,z) accelerations with the gravitational acceleration g removed 

Magnetometer (Compass sensor)
8.  headingAccuracy - may not be avialable, don't know how it's computed

9.  magneticHeading - orientation relative to north pole referenced to the top of the phone screen

10. rawVector - the magnetic field components referenced to the norh pole
